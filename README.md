Faceback is an interactive, intuitive interface that allows instructors to receive feedback in real-time with a simple emoji response system.

Student users can join class groups or presentation sessions and rate their understanding on a scale of emojis. Instructor users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete classes and sessions. In addition to creating groups for ongoing classes, an instructor can share the classroom URL with guests who can participate as students for individual sessions.

The ratings of all the students in the class are tallied and the total is displayed to both the instructor and the other student users. As a studentâ€™s understanding changes, they can change their rating and the total is immediately updated.

Faceback provides a platform for presenters to receive live feedback, and gives students the opportunity to voice their needs without having to interrupt the class flow.
